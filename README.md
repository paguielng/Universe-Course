# How to Use the "Measuring the Size of the Universe" Course

This interactive HTML course explores the methods astronomers use to measure the vast distances of our universe, progressing from basic concepts to advanced techniques. The course includes interactive visualizations, calculators, and a quiz to enhance your learning experience.

## Getting Started

1. Extract the `universe_course.zip` file to a location on your computer.
2. Open the `final/index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).
3. The course will load and you can begin your journey through cosmic distance measurement.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into six modules:

1. **Introduction to Cosmic Measurements** - Historical perspective and the concept of the cosmic distance ladder
2. **Foundations of Distance Measurement** - Solar system measurements and parallax
3. **Standard Candles and Cosmic Yardsticks** - Cepheid variables and stellar populations
4. **Extending to Galaxies and Beyond** - Supernovae and redshift
5. **Advanced Measurement Techniques** - Gravitational lensing and cosmic microwave background
6. **The Future of Cosmic Measurement** - Current challenges and next-generation techniques

## Interactive Elements

The course includes several interactive elements:

- **Cosmic Distance Scale Visualization** - Explore the vast range of distances in our universe
- **Parallax Demonstration** - See how astronomers use Earth's orbit to measure stellar distances
- **Cepheid Variable Calculator** - Calculate distances using the period-luminosity relationship
- **Redshift Calculator** - Determine distances based on the expansion of the universe
- **HR Diagram** - Explore how stellar properties relate to distance measurements
- **Quiz** - Test your understanding of cosmic distance measurement concepts

## Technical Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- JavaScript enabled
- Internet connection (for loading external libraries like D3.js and Chart.js)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
2. Try using a different web browser
